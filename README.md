# Spotify-like music player

This is a simple web music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The project simulates a basic music player that allows you to play songs, view album covers, and interact with the UI. It uses static assets for audio files and images to create a visually appealing interface.

- **app/**: Contains other assets including background images and logos.

You can add songs and cover or background images in the placeholders provided as per your choice. I can't add it here, because of copyright issues
